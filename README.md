SpringMVC-Todo
==============

Goal of this project is to create a Todo Application using Spring MVC that will be submitted to the [TodoMVC project](http://todomvc.com/).

Most of the functionality will be implemented based on the [application specifications](https://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc/wiki/App-Specification),
but I will be adding some additional functionality like an iPad mobile interface, MongoDB persistence and support for several popular PAAS services.

Out of the box, this application will work in Amazon BeanStalk, VMWare Cloudfoundry, RedHat OpenShift, Google App Engine, CloudBees and Jelastic 
in addition to local installs of Tomcat, Jetty, Resin, Glassfish and WebLogic.
